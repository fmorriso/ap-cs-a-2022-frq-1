# AP CA A - 2022 - FRQ #1
A runnable solution to the AP CS A Exam FRQ #1
## Notes:
* I added a few extra methods to the `Level` and `Game` classes to facilitate the creation and running of the `Driver` class.
* There are two methods in the main method of class `Driver`:
    * PartA() - will run the four test cases documented in the FRQ
    * PartB() - will run the `playManyTimes` method and display the high score.
